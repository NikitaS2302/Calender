ðŸ“… Calendar Reminder App (Python Tkinter)

This is a Python-based Calendar Reminder Application built using the Tkinter GUI toolkit and Pythonâ€™s built-in calendar and datetime modules. The app allows users to view monthly calendars, navigate between months, and manage reminders for specific dates in an interactive and user-friendly way.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

Displays the current month and year with weekday headers.
Navigation buttons (< and >) to switch between months.
Each valid date is represented as a clickable button.
Users can Add, View, and Delete reminders for any selected date.
Dates with reminders are highlighted in light green for better visibility.
Simple dialog boxes (tkinter.simpledialog and tkinter.messagebox) provide intuitive user interactions.


ðŸ”¹ Learning Outcomes:
This project helped me explore GUI development in Python, event handling, and user input management. It also strengthened my understanding of state management in interactive applications.

The Calendar Reminder App is a beginner-friendly yet practical project showcasing Pythonâ€™s capability beyond scripting and data analysis.
